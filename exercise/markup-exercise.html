	<p>2018 Update: Before I had mastered the art of the salted brown butter crispy treat and my 40-minute naptime brownies,
		<br> this was my go-to, back-pocket, too-easy-to-skip dessert. For years, before every party, I’d mix up a pan of these basically
		<br> from memory because that’s how easy they are: 
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 (stick of butter)
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; + 1 (cup of sugar)
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; + 1 (egg) 
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; + 1 (cup of flour)
		<br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; + 1 1/2 (cups of mix-ins, for me usually chocolate
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; chips and nuts but your mileage may vary,
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; maybe you like dried fruit or crumbled
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; heath bars or candy canes here, I mean,
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; who wouldn’t? but more suggestions are
		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at the end)
		<br> then 20 minutes in the oven for extra-gooey, 25 for set but still buttery, and look, you did it, and all in one bowl in under
		<br> 45 minutes. I began making them with brown butter in 2014 and have never looked back. Not all baked goods with brown
		<br> butter have a toasty butter flavor you can taste in the end; these absolutely do.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>8 tablespoons (1 stick, 4 ounces or 115 grams) unsalted butter 1 cup (190 grams) light or dark brown sugar</li>
		<li>1 large egg</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt, or 1/4 teaspoon coarse sea salt 1 cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>1 1/2 cups mix-ins of you choice (my favorite: 1 cup chocolate chips plus 1/2 cup chopped toasted walnuts, see below
			<br>for more suggestions)</li>
	</ul>
	
		<p>Heat oven to 350°F. Butter an 8×8-inch baking pan, or line the bottom and two sides of one with parchment paper, buttering<br>the exposed parts.</p>
		<p>Melt butter in a small saucepan; I like to keep cooking it, stirring occasionally, until it becomes toasty and browned at the<br>bottom and has an unbelievable aroma. It’s definitely worth the trouble here. Pour into a medium or large bowl and whisk in<br>sugar until smooth. At this point, it should be cooled to lukewarm, but if it’s not, let it rest for a few minutes until it is, then 
			<br> whisk in egg, vanilla, and sea salt. Stir in flour and additions of your choice.</p>
		<p>Scrape into prepared pan and smooth with spatula; the batter is thick and will take some nudging. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, 
		<br>until lightly browned at edges but looks a tiny bit underbaked. (I always err on the side of caution with baking times—nobody
		<br> ever complained about a gooey-middled cookie.) Let blondies cool in pan, or just let them cool in it for 10 minutes and use
		<br> the parchment sling to slide them onto a cutting board. Cut into 16 or more squares.</p>
	<p> Leftover (ha!) blondies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.</p>
	<p> <i>Ideas for additions: Chopped nuts, toasting them first for better flavor; 2 tablespoons espresso powder; 1/2 teaspoon mint or
	<br>almond extract in place of the vanilla; 1/2 cup dried fruit; 1/4 cup bourbon, scotch or other whiskey (increase the flour by 1
<br>tablespoon); a mix of chopped chocolate or candy bars (toffee bits would be fantastic here); peanut butter chips instead of
<br>chocolate chips.</i> </p>

	<p> Expanded notes, 2018: Here are some of the FAQ questions about these over the years:
	<p> <i> <b>“Mine look smaller, why do yours look thick?” </i> </b><br>
	These are, in fact, a thin blondie, similar in thickness to the brownie recipes on this site. However the original images were
<br>a little confusing because for parties, I’d always cut them into little 1-inch squares as I believe that all foods eaten standing
<br>up, especially at parties, shouldn’t be more than a single bite, at a time or becomes complicated to hold your drink too, or
<br>worse, you get crumbs in it, which would be unacceptable. Rules are rules.</p>
	<p> <i> <b>“Mine were so flat, why don’t you put baking powder or baking soda in them?”</b> </i> 
		<br>Blondies are also known as ‘butterscotch brownies,’ and brownies, I firmly believe, have no place for baking powder or
		<br>baking soda in them. That would make them cake. I have no interest in either being cakey. I prefer them chewy, with just a
		<br>little puff and crackle that comes from baking with an egg. If you must add baking powder, I won’t judge; the common
		<br>measurement for a blondie recipe of this volume is 3/4 teaspoon. Stir it in with the flour.</p>
	<p> <i> <b>“Mine took longer to bake.”</b> </i> 
		<br> My bad. I call these “infinitely adaptable” because they are, but failed to mention that wet ingredients (bananas, bourbon)
		<br> will probably add baking time. Bananas are probably the riskiest of this, and I’m now nixing them as a suggestion, although
		<br> I don’t think any harm would come from a couple tablespoons of mashed banana, if you so desire.</p>
	<p> <i> <b>“Mine came out hard.”</b> </i>  
		<br>  Don’t overbake these, just don’t. Like a good chocolate chip or oatmeal cookie, the way to have a slight gooey texture in the
		<br> center when you’re done is to take them out before they look fully done. By the time they look fully done, they’ll cool off and
		<br>seem a little crunchy.</p>
	<p> <i> <b>“Can I double these?”</b> </i> <br> Absolutely, in a 9×13-inch pan. They’ll end up a tiny bit thicker.</p>
